  In order to currently run the user interface, you will need to install TkinterDnD package:
  Download and install tkdnd2.8 in \tcl of Python install. https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdnd/
  Download and install TkinterDnD2 in the \Lib\site-packages of Python install. https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkinterdnd/
  Make sure that the interpreter you use to run and compiler batch_ui.py is using the same install folder of Python that the TkinterDnD is installed.
