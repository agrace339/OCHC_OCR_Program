batch_ui.py - User Interface for the Batch Conversion code
In order to currently run the user interface, you will need to install TkinterDnD package:
Download and install tkdnd2.8 in \tcl of Python install. https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdnd/
Download and install TkinterDnD2 in the \Lib\site-packages of Python install. https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkinterdnd/
Make sure that the interpreter you use to run and compiler batch_ui.py is using the same install folder of Python that the TkinterDnD is installed.
