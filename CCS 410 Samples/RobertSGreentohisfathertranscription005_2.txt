“Hope is a lover's staff
Walk hence in that and manage it against despairing thoughts.” So says Shakespeare. At present
fortune smiles, or rather Fenton smiles, in his smile I am made happy but in his frown miserable.
So complete is my dependence on him that were he to turn me away I do not know what would
become of me. But I do not intend he shall turn me away until my year is up and when it is I
intend he shall be glad to employ me for another at $400.
Love to all, Your affectionate son Robert
The young men of Utica friendly to the administration have yesterday go up a paper for the
purpose of calling a meeting to balance the meeting at Hampton; in two days they got upwards
of 300 names on it in this village. Mine among the number. Glad to make even this small figure
in defence (sic) virtue.
